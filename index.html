    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm a data scientist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I recently created <a href="https://selectstarsql.com">Select Star SQL</a>, an interactive book for learning SQL and <a href="socraticregression">Socratic Regression</a>, a geometric guide to linear regression.</p>
    <p>Some of my formative experiences were at:
      <ul>
        <li>The Chinese High School, Singapore</li>
        <li>Delta Wing, Officer Cadet School</li>
        <li>The University of Chicago</li>
        <li><a href='https://www.quora.com/profile/Kao-Zi-Chong'>Quora's</a> data science team</li>
        <li>The <a href='https://www.recurse.com'>Recurse Center</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The outdoors are a big part of my life. I climb and sail.</p>
    <h1>Kaomorphism</h1>
    <p>In math, a morphism is a transformation that preserves the structure of a space. Likewise, a kaomorphism applies Kao's worldview while, at least in theory, preserving the fundamental truths of the world. A kaomorphism could also refer to the Kao - Eric Morphis friendship.</p>
